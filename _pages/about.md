## Kavana Venkatesh

I am a PhD student at Virginia Tech. Previously, I earned my master's degee in Data Science from Northeastern University, Boston. My research focuses on Large Language Models and extending the evolving technology in NLP to Computer Vision tasks, especially Diffusion Models.

My work aims to develop interpretable and efficient generative models to enable safe consumption of AI at scale across diverse domains. Specific areas of focus include:

- **[Key Research Focus Area #1]:** [Brief description, e.g., leveraging large-scale machine learning models to improve human-AI interaction.]
- **[Key Research Focus Area #2]:** [Brief description, e.g., enhancing efficiency in neural networks for resource-constrained environments.]
- **[Key Research Focus Area #3]:** [Brief description, e.g., developing innovative approaches for multimodal learning and integration.]
- **[Key Research Focus Area #4]:** [Brief description, e.g., creating explainable AI systems to foster trust and transparency in critical domains.]
- **[Key Research Focus Area #5]:** [Brief description, e.g., exploring novel optimization techniques for large language models.]
