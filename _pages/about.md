I am a PhD student at Virginia Tech. Previously, I earned my master's degee in Data Science from Northeastern University, Boston. My research focuses on Large Language Models and extending the evolving technology in NLP to Computer Vision tasks, especially Diffusion Models.

My work aims to develop interpretable and efficient generative models to enable safe consumption of AI at scale across diverse domains. Specific areas of focus include:

- **Interpretability of Large Language Models:** Understanding internal models and thought processes behind the reasoning of LLMs
- **Agentic Framework and Tool Usage:** Researching efficient agentic ecosystems for collaborative reasoning and smart tool usage in LLMs
- **Evaluation and Benchmarking for LLMs:** Developing innovative and dependable approaches to evaluate LLMs for complex scenarios
- **Knowledge Distillation and Optimization of LLMs:** Exploring novel optimization techniques to develop smaller and efficient LLMs
- **Applications of LLMs in vision:** Transferring the evolving techniques in NLP to vision, especially diffusion models for high-fidelity image generation
