title: "Context Canvas: Enhancing Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Knowledge Graph-Based RAG"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2024-12-12-Context-Canvas-number-1
excerpt: 'We introduce a novel approach to enhance T2I diffusion models by incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation with a knowledge graph. We also propose an iterative RAG-context guided self-correction and a RAG-based image editing approach for high-fidelity generation of complex, domain-specific images.'
