collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'We introduce a novel approach to enhance T2I diffusion models by incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation with a knowledge graph. We also propose an iterative RAG-context guided self-correction and a RAG-based image editing approach for high-fidelity generation of complex, domain-specific images.'
